# Continuous Reasoning for Placement Logic - Prolog Prototype

This repository contains a Prolog prototype implementing:
- Separation Logic for placement states
- An operational Continuous Reasoning model
- Local repair of overloaded nodes using residual capacity
- Recomposition into a globally well-formed state

The system supports:
1. wf/1 : well-formedness checking
2. sep/3 : resource separation operator
3. the separating conjunction (operator: ★ ) 
4. crSep/3 : continuous-reasoning separation
5. repair/3 : repair of overloaded components
6. cr/4 : full continuous-reasoning cycle
